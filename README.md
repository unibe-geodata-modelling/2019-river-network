Simplification of the Swiss River Network

In this Python Script we are using the Python Interface and Python Commands of QGIS to create a simplification of the river network in Switzerland. This simplification can be used as a separate zoom level for the river network displayed for example on web pages with interactive maps. The advantage of the simplification is that the maps are easier to handle due to smaller sata size and on web pages they can be more easily implemented and use less bandwidth on web pages, thus load faster and are more convienent for user. 

The tools we used are Python 3.7, the IDE PyCharm 2019.3 Community Edition and QGIS 3.8.3 "Zanzibar". This script was created in the context of the seminar "Geodata analysis and modeling" of the master program in Geography at the university of Bern (Switzerland), supervised by Pascal Horton, Andreas Zischg and Jorge Ramirez. For more information on our script and the seminar, see our project report in this branch.

# Acknowledgments

We would like to thank our supervisors Pascal Horton, Andreas Zischg and Jorge Ramirez for introducing us to our topic and supporting us throughout our learning process. While we worked on this project, we could always look to them for help on the programming and scripting, as they were answering our questions as well as possible.
